# Final_Project
## Overview
- Selected topic
	- [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://github.com/nvuono625/Final_Project/blob/NVuono_Square/Resources/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data-update.csv)
	- Google Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lf6xTJPvfWeE9aqnDYtFyqe7-ScPtTFNq3beuKu3Z6A/edit#slide=id.g11e19c5e411_0_15

- Reason they selected the topic
	- The reason we selected this topic is because it is something that our team was interested in. According to the World Health Organization, 11% of total deaths globally are caused by strokes and it would be a benefit to the public to be able to predict the likelihood based on personal traits, ie. gender, age, various diseases, smoking status, etc.

- Description of the source of data
	- The dataset is a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file that includes patient's personal information. Each line/row of the dataset includes relevant imformation to each patient in a certain sequence separated by commas so that the information can be opened in a application like excel or as a charted dataset. The sequence is as follows:
        id, gender, hypertension, heart_disease, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
	- A CSV file is however able to be parsed and set up into an array so that you can work with the data in other languages.

- Questions they hope to answer with the data
	- With this data, we hope to answer the likelihood of a stroke based on a patient's personal health. 

- Description of the communication protocols 
	- Our communication occurs over zoom and in slack to send updates to each other. The success of our project depends on our ability to collaborate as a team.
