# Final_Project
Overview
- Selected topic
	- Stroke Prediction Dataset

- Reason they selected the topic
	- The reason we selected this topic is because it is something that our team was interested in. According to the World Health Organization, 11% of total deaths globally are caused by strokes and it would be a benefit to the public to be able to predict the likihood based on personal traits, ie. gender, age, various diseases, smoking status, etc.

- Description of the source of data
	- The dataset is a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file that includes patient's personal information. Each line/row of the dataset includes relevant imformation to each patient in a certain sequence separated by commas so that the information can be opened in a application like excel or as a charted dataset. The sequence is as follows:
        id, gender, hypertension, heart_disease, work_type, Residence_type, avg_glucose_level, bmi, smoking_status, stroke
	- A CSV file is however able to be parsed and set up into an array so that you can work with the data in other languages.

- Questions they hope to answer with the data
	- With this data, we hope to answer the likelihood of a stroke based on a patient's personal health.
